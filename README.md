===============

A program for the Insyte Home Automation controller:
- ModBus
- GSM
- 1-wire
- Ethernet
- Power relays
- Analog input and outputs
- Digital inputs

Compiler for Insyte controllers is a C-style, but has very poor functionality. It doesn't support even functions. So the code is a little awkward.
